2024-12-14: 
- initial build of update-server.py
- migrate-instances: 
    - Added support for copying over options.txt. 
    - Added error handling for if source folder to migrate does not exist.

2025-04-13: 
update-server
- added optional commandline parameters:
    - showing public IP is now a parameter (which is disabled by default)
    - option to keep "dump" folder (default behavior is now to delete it)
- general failure exit code is now 1 (was -1)
- new return codes:
    - 1 => general failure
    - 2 => error parsing commandline arguments
- junk files now moved to folder starting with "old_" (was "dump_")
- general refactor
    - server path is no longer converted to literal path before use. Script now uses whatever is passed at runtime.
    - removed functions

migrate-instances
- removed json settings file (replaced with constants)
- slightly reworded some messages
- refactored and more robust instance validation:
    - new function includes both selection prompt and integrity checks
    - now supports instances with "minecraft" (not ".minecraft") folder
        - confirms both don't exist

2025-06-xx:
- Combined migrate-instances and update-server into a single script.
- Arguments for single script are passed from settings json file; see readme for details.
- introduced colored text output
- for instance migration: 
    - general refactoring
    - now expects source and destination paths to be to the minecraft or .minecraft folder, instead of trying to deduce which it has from the root
    - no longer shows message for each individual file copied
- for server update:
    - general refactoring
    - prints commands to run to launch server
